Wingie is a handheld stereo resonator with built-in microphones that also doubles as a development board. Its dual onboard microphones allow you to interact and enrich vocals as well as the sonic environment around you.

If you sing to it, Wingie responds with marvelously complex harmonies. Or play it as a percussive instrument and create acoustic feedback with your speakers. Wingie is small enough you can simply take it along with you and resonate with the world. However you decide to use it, Wingie can deliver a lush stereo image by just locating the sweet spots. Itâ€™s all right there in your hands.
