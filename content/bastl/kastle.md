The Bastl Kastle is a mini modular synthesizer you can play anywhere. It's powered by just 3 AA batteries or a regular micro USB charger, and it offers a headphone output and 2 in/out ports for interfacing other gear, be it a keyboard, a groove box, or a Eurorack synth.

The device is DIY-friendly and ideal for beginners in synthesis, but it will also add unique functionality to any full-sized modular synthesizer system. It delivers the fun of modular at a low cost, and it fits into your pocket so you can play it anywhere.

Kastl comes in [arp](https://bastl-instruments.com/instruments/kastle-arp) and [drum](https://bastl-instruments.com/instruments/kastle-drum) variants.
