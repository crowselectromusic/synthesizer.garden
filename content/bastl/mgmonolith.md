Take granular sampling into your own hands: lo-fi sounds, so-phisticated style

Grannyâ€™s back with a brand new lid: our classic desktop granular sampler gets a facelift, bringing her into the modern age with enough usability upgrades to last another lifetime, rehomed in sleek black PCB-material to help it look the part amongst the latest in the Bastl range.

The Microgranny 2.0 that you know and love is still there under the facelift: lo-fi sound full of character packed into a hands-on monophonic desktop sampler that is a joy to experiment with. Plug in your microSD card loaded with 8-bit samples, or record them live through the in-built mic or line input, and jump into play with 6 samples right under your fingers, or instantly recall up to 60 saved presets.
