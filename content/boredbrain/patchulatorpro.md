- Ten discrete send and return channels for effects and instruments
- Additional main instrument channel switchable between two effects chains
- TRS connections support stereo, mono, and balanced audio signals
- Includes twelve custom 10-inch mini patch cables (TRS)
- Passive design for routing all types of signals

Patchulator Pro is an evolution of Boredbrain’s iconic desktop and pedalboard patchbay, purpose-built for experimental signal routing of guitar pedals, effects, synths and more. The patchbay has ten individual effects channels, plus a main instrument channel capable of switching between two parallel effects chains or bypassing them entirely.

atchulator Pro’s ten numbered channels are primarily used for pedals or effects processors, and allow chains of effects to be created on-the-fly using a few mini patch cables. First, the inputs and outputs of pedals and effects are connected to the send (gray) and return (black) 1/4-inch jacks on the rear of the patchbay. Then using the top 3.5 mm jacks labeled SND and RCV, signals can be routed freely through the effects channels to make a chain.

Alternatively, instrument sources (and destinations) can also connect to any of these ten channels for direct patch access if the dedicated MAIN I/O instrument channel is not enough.
