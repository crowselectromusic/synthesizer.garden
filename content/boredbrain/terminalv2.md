Terminal adds routing flexibility to signal chains of guitar pedal effects, electronic instruments and other audio devices. The half-normal patchbay is designed to easily copy signals, insert effects into primary signal paths, and re-route signals to alternate destinations.

This simple but very useful design was originally a custom project for musician Tycho, who is using Terminal in his studio and live rigs to quickly patch between sections of pedal and instrument chains. Community interest in the product led Boredbrain to produce Terminal in limited batches, and then due to its popularity, it has now become a mainstay.
