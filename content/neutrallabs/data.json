      "description": "\n\nThe successor to the widely acclaimed Elmyra, Elmyra 2 is a 4-voice digital/analog hybrid drone synthesizer and platform for microtonal sonic exploration, capable of creating anything from lush ambient soundscapes to gritty droning textures and shrieking noises, available as a 42 HP Eurorack module or semi-modular desktop synth. With 31 modulation targets, 4 polymetric sequencers, delay, additional per-voice effects, a choice of various filters, as well as onboard LFOs and utilities, it is essentially a purpose-built small modular system in itself. A set of preset cards (included) or electronic components like capacitors or diodes can be plugged into the front panel in order to change the sound character."
