It made me sad that there was no great directory of interesting contemporary electronic musical instruments out there. [ModularGrid](https://modulargrid.net/) exists for modules, [Vintage Synth Explorer](https://www.vintagesynth.com/) exists for older gear / big name stuff, and you can visit perfect cricuit or similar and browse their inventory - but some of the most interesting gear isn't stocked at large synth sellers. I wanted something that focussed on contemporary instruments, small synth makers and gear for unsual music (noise, drone, ambient).

The layout / navigation of of the site is a work in progress, but please feel free to suggest ways you'd like to be able to browse the content (e.g. by tag, by company). The content of the site is [open source](https://github.com/crowselectromusic/synthesizer.garden/), so please add your favourite piece of gear, or correct any mistakes you find.

I hope you find it useful!
