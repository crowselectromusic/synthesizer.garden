Hex lag is a digital sound processing instrument with signal modulating potentiometers and an interactive tactile surface for direct sound control. It digitally simulates analogue bucket brigade delay chips (typical of chorus, flanger and karplus-strong), but also enables pitch-shifting, downsampling, etc. 

There is a triple header row next to the input jack for interfacing with external control voltages. The top pin is connected to GND, the middle to SPREAD and the bottom to RATE potentiometer. Both SPREAD and RATE expect a unipolar signal 0-5V.
