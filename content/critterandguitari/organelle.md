The dream behind the Organelle was to have a small and easy-to-use instrument that could perform any kind of sound synthesis imaginable. The Organelle excels at synthesizing sound. Between the synth patches that ship with the Organelle and the growing list of user-contributed patches there’s a bit of everything to play with: additive and subtractive synthesis, classic wave table sounds, granular, physical modeling, ADSR envelope style, frequency modulation, and more. The best part is that there’s always the option of creating your own synth in Pure Data too!

Organelle comes in two flavors, Organelle S and Organelle M. The Organelle S is for musicians who like what they see and hear in the Organelle M but don't need the portability of the M's battery power and speaker.

In all other functions, the S is identical to the M. They share same patches, processor, RAM, audio & MIDI connections, keys, knobs, screen, microphone, HDMI output, USB ports, and power adapter.
