5 Moons is a multitrack recorder. On one hand, it's a tool to record your creativity. Build up layers of tracks and enjoy crafting that perfect song or field recording.

On the other hand, it helps you create new sounds! Looping and bounce down functions open up new dimensions for your sound and fun ways for your tracks to interact with each other!

The unassuming wood enclosure draws you in, but hidden inside are high fidelity electronics designed for rich recordings. Its sleek user interface offers crisp control and ample room for sonic experimentation.
