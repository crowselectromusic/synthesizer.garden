OVUM is a standalone all-analog tool for exploratory sound synthesis. Five independently controlled triangle-core oscillators give you five lush voices to layer and evolve. Each voice has a separate control for volume, pitch, and tone, and can be switched between a bright square wave and a crisp triangle wave.
