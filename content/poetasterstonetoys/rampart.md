Rampart is a mini-modular synth and experimental box built around the Arduino Nano or the slightly faster and better equipped LGT8F328P – LQFP32. 

Rampart is designed to allow you to build synths that can be controlled with CV input or produce CV. It has audio/clk input and output, the input being pocket operator compatible. The kit includes a lgt8f328p which has slightly better features than the original Arduino Nano.

> I’ve been making the original variant for years as a means to creating small synths to interact with other small synths like [bastl’s](@/bastl/_index.md) [Kastle](@/bastl/kastle.md). And of course, my own [Keep](@/poetasterstonetoys/keep.md).
