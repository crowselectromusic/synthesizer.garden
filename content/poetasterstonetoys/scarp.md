Scarp is a platform for building musical toys that need buttons :) It uses a Raspberry Pi Pico as a processor.

I was frustrated with my pocket operators and got some inspiration from picokore. Because I’d like to swap things in the design I decided to make a slightly bigger thing where you can actually get at all the pins. Also, I decided to make a design where you can swap the use of the SDA/SCL pins between a DAC and a display. I also wanted to add a way to move the grooves when chaining with Pocketoperators without the hassle. With scarp, it’s a few simple movements to modify the groove while your playing live.
