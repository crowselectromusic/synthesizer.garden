The Stylophone BEAT is a pocket-sized drum machine that lets you make fun beats and basslines any time, anywhere. It's quick and easy to create drum & bass loops using four unique sound banks: ROK, TECHNO, HIPHOP & BEATBOX. Tap the built-in stylus on the circular beat pad, choose different drum kits and bass sounds, and record multiple layers on the fly.
