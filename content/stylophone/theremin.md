The Stylophone Theremin is a portable touch sensitive synthesizer that creates experimental sounds by detecting your movement. Wave your hand around its antenna, move its slide from side to side, and go over the edge with mad modulation, wobbly vibrato, and crunchy echoing delay for crazy, quirky, sci-fi sound creation. Powered by AA batteries and featuring a built-in speaker & headphone connection, play it anywhere! No theremin experience required.
