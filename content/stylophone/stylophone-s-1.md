The Stylophone is an iconic mini synth, known for its super-fun stylus, compact design, and unique retro sound. Used by everyone from David Bowie to The White Stripes, the latest Stylophone features the same quirky vintage analog sound as the original, first released in 1968. It has a built in speaker with volume control and optional headphone jack, a headphone socket for private play, 3 Octaves and vibrato effect. Batteries required: 3 x AA (not included)
