+++

An 8 channel powerless instrument which is activated and modulated using voltage from external sequencers. Analog circuits are powered momentarily by incoming gate and control voltage signals causing them to oscillate and breathe naturally. When these circuits are linked together they can grow, inform and process one another in complex rhythmic ways.
