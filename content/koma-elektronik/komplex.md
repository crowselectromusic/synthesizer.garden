+++

Powerful step sequencer built around four well-equipped full-featured 16-step sequencers communicating via both MIDI and CV/Gate. There are no screens or submenus.

All features have their own dedicated controls and have their own dedicated in- and outputs on the large 87-point patch bay. Every aspect of this sequencer is CV-able. Lastly a seven bank CV Recorder is on board and can output up to 5 banks at once!

The Komplex Sequencer opens up a whole new world of creative possibilities and starts where other sequencers have stopped!

Orginally released in 2015, later discontinued then re-released in 2023.
