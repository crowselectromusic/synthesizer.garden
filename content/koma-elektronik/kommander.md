CV/Gate Motion Controller

The Kommander is a handheld dual infrared X-Y motion controller that makes controlling your electronic instruments intuitive and fun. The device measures the distance to other objects and sends out corresponding CV signals between 0 and 8 volts and a trigger with adjustable threshold. This helps you to interact better with your instruments and create complex synth sounds, trigger a drum machine, control your KOMA Field Kits or any other instrument that is capable of receiving CV / Gate signals.

The Kommander has a working range of around 40 â€“ 50cm depending on how it is used.

The attenuators on the back panel allow you to attenuate the maximum voltage output, so you can e.g. set the range from 0V to 5V. Just plug the Kommander into your synthesizer and create! The Kommander ships with a 9V PSU.
