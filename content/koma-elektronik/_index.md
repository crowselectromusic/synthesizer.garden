Based in Berlin, Germany - Koma Elektronik is a crew of artists, engineers & synth enthusiasts. They design and build music electronics for inspiration and aspiration. Gear that challenges you to experiment, to try out new things and explore. Gear that is fun to play together with friends. Gear that pushes your music forward.

KOMA was founded in 2010. It all started out with building boutique effect pedals and later moved into gestural musical control, komplex sequencing, quadraphonic mixing and the electro-acoustic domain.
