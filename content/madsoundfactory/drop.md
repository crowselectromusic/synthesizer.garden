You cannot describe exactly what it is â€” you can make any kind of music using the Drop, from roots pre-sequences techno to ambient landscapes, from 8-bit craze to pop-style dancy-fancies.

And you'll play it live - Drop is designed to be played, just like a classic music instrument.

A self-contained analog groovebox, that uses LFO as a clock generator with divider - no programming needed to get highly complex absolutely crazy neverending and never repeating (analog!) rhytmic galore and fractal textures.
