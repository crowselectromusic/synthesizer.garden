### Contributing

All the content for this site lives in the `content` directory. 
To add or make a change, you can edit documents and create a "pull request" with your suggested changes directly from github - all you need is a github account. Just follow the structure of the existing documents.

Contribution rules/guidelines:

- Please add small makers only. If you want to know about gear from Yamaha, Korg, Roland, or Behringer, they will tell you about it. Mid-size companies like Moog or Arturia might eventually be on here, but we are in no rush to add them.
- Please only add gear that is currently available for purchase or DIY-ing. We're not planning to remove stuff that's discontinued, but vintage gear doesn't belong on here.
- No eurorack, or other modular systems. We love eurorack, but there's better places to find out about that (e.g. https://modulargrid.net/).

### Developer guide

- This site uses Zola, a static site generator in rust. It's hosted by github pages.
- Styling uses [picocss](https://picocss.com/).

## TODO:

- Search is working, but needs theming, and needs to include tags before it can go live.
